This a commandline tool to read the xml files generated as part of the [DnDAppFiles](https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles) project

To get the xml files for this tool go [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hiavsiegq28xd7u/AABcMGhKcr8CYgeKaHK1ZDzJa?dl=0) to download them from dropbox

You will need to install some dependencies, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` inside the directory with the file names requirements.txt 

Right now the file locations it looks at are specific to my machine so you will have to edit utils.py > setup to use it on your machine.  Soon I will be changing that to be more user friendly.
