This a commandline tool to read the xml files generated as part of the [DnDAppFiles](https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles) project

Right now the file locations it looks at are specific to my machine so you will have to edit utils.py > setup to use it on your machine.  Soon I will be changing that to be more user friendly.
